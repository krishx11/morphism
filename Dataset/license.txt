The AMSL Face Morph Image Data Set includes:

1. Genuine (non-morphed) face images from

   a. the Face Research Lab London Set (CC BY 4.0, https://figshare.com/articles/Face_Research_Lab_London_Set/5047666)
   b. the Utrecht ECVP Dataset (PICS, see http://pics.stir.ac.uk/) modified in the way to comply with the requirements of the ICAO portrait quality standard for eMRTD [1] and to fit on a chip of an eMRTD

2. Morphed face images generated from the selected pairs of face images in the two aforementioned data sets using the morphing approach reported in [2].
